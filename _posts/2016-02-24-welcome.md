High Performance Computing Center

UCR has for quite some time had a computer cluster dedicated to bioinformatics.
It has informally been available to all disciplines and now we are formalizing its availability to the entire campus.
It will be renamed the High Performance Computing Center (until someone can suggest a clever acronym). 

I'm pleased to announce that Thomas Girke has agreed to be director of the center.
Please join Thomas for the lunch on Feb 13 (sign up above) to discuss high performance computing general.
In addition to our system http://facility.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/resources/hardware another goal is to facilitate the use of cloud computing at commercial service and facilitate use of supercomputers such as those at UCSD and LBNL.
